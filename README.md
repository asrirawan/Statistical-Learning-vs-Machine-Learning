# Statistical-Learning-vs-Machine-Learning
### Here are some of the differences:
* Both approaches rely on data, yet Statistical Learning employs rule-based programming, formalizing relationships between variables. In contrast, Machine Learning learns directly from data without explicit programming instructions.
* Statistical Learning typically operates on smaller datasets with fewer attributes compared to Machine Learning, which can handle vast amounts of data and attributes.
* Statistical Learning often relies on assumptions like normality, absence of multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity, whereas Machine Learning is less reliant on assumptions and frequently disregards them.
* While Statistical Learning focuses largely on making inferences, drawing ideas from samples, populations, and hypotheses, Machine Learning prioritizes predictions and encompasses various methodologies including supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning.
* Statistical Learning involves intensive mathematical computations, primarily relying on coefficient estimation and necessitating a thorough understanding of the data. Conversely, Machine Learning automates pattern identification through iterative processes, requiring comparatively less human intervention.
